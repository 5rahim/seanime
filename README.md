üö® **Important note**: This is a one-person project and may not meet every use case. If it doesn‚Äôt fully fit your needs, other tools might be a better match.

### Not planned

- Support for other providers such as Trakt, SIMKL, etc.
- Support for other media players
- Dedicated clients (TV, mobile, etc.)
- Support for Usenet, private trackers
- Support for other languages (internationalization)

These features will not be implemented, mainly due to the scope of the project, time required or lack of resources.
